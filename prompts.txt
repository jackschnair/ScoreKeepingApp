Creating "createLeague" lambda function prompts:

1. I would like to write an aws lambda function that recieves arguments for 'name', 'sport',  and 'credentials'. These arguments will be written to a mysql aws database. credentials should be hashed rather than in plaintext. Return a 200 code if it worked and 400 if there was an error
2. information from db host should be gotten from config.mjs in the same directory
3. can you write this file to work for .mjs

notes: Wierdly insistent that I was trying to create a scorekeeper instead of a league, even after I corrected.
