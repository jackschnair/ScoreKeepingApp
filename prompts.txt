Creating "createLeague" lambda function prompts:
1. I would like to write an aws lambda function that recieves arguments for 'name', 'sport',  and 'credentials'. These arguments will be written to a mysql aws database. credentials should be hashed rather than in plaintext. Return a 200 code if it worked and 400 if there was an error
2. information from db host should be gotten from config.mjs in the same directory
3. can you write this file to work for .mjs
notes: Wierdly insistent that I was trying to create a scorekeeper instead of a league, even after I corrected.

Creating "deleteLeague" lambda function prompts:
1. I would like to make an aws lambda function for 'deleteLeague' that follows the template of the 'createLeague' directory, but will remove a league from the sql database based on league name passed to the function
notes: wanted to overwrite my file instead of creating a new one. I guess that is a limitation.

Creating "createScorekeeper" prompts: 
1. instead of this file creating a league, I would like to create a scorekeeper. It will recieve a 'name', 'league', and 'credientials'. It will write these to the database as well as 'registration_status', which will be 0
notes: I had to add the registration_status part myself. 
    I suppose I could have made it the defualt in the database instead.
    It also assumed the wrong inputs.
